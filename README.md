Project: User Registration and Login with Password Hashing and JWT Token

Description:
Developed a secure and efficient User Registration and Login system using modern authentication techniques. The system incorporated password hashing for enhanced security and utilized JWT (JSON Web Token) for managing user sessions.

Technologies Used:
- Spring Boot
- Java
- Spring Security
- BCrypt (for password hashing)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

Key Contributions:
- Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints for user registration and login functionalities.
- Utilized Spring Security for secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Implemented password hashing using BCrypt to store user passwords securely in the database.
- Utilized JWT for token-based authentication, ensuring efficient and stateless user sessions.
- Developed token refresh functionality to manage token expiration and provide a seamless user experience.
- Conducted thorough testing to validate the API's functionality and security, including unit tests and integration testing.
- Implemented data validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and improve the API's robustness.
- Documented the API endpoints and authentication flow to assist developers and stakeholders in integrating and understanding the functionality.
- Utilized version control (e.g., Git) to track code changes and enable collaboration with the development team.

Results:
- Successfully delivered a secure and user-friendly User Registration and Login system, enhancing the overall security of user credentials.
- Improved user experience by implementing token-based authentication, eliminating the need for maintaining server-side sessions.
- Enhanced data privacy and security through password hashing, preventing unauthorized access to user passwords.
- Received positive feedback from the development team and project stakeholders for meeting project objectives and delivering high-quality code.
